## Background

The Covid-19 pandemic, which until now has not ended, has had significant transitional impacts on various sectors of people's lives nationally. In addition to the health sector which is directly affected, there are also economic sectors which performance has decreased significantly.

This decline in performance is of course in line with the increasing rate of the national poverty rate, thereby reducing the people's standard of living. This is of course has become a burden for the state, especially in the swelling of the use of state treasury in the form of implementing a pandemic response program without being accompanied by an adequate contribution of cash income.

In addition, the middle class to the marginalized are considered to be very affected due to the limitations of socio-economic activities and the existing business opportunities, causing their condition to be very frictional with meeting the needs of daily life. Therefore, this is the interest of this Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to further investigate the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), poverty rate, and unemployment rate in West Java.

## Methods

- Statistical Analysis
- Visualization
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- Clustering

## Results

West Java Province ranks third in the worst poverty rate on the island of Java and experienced an increase in 2019 when the pandemic began. From the analysis, it can be seen that the pandemic has had a serious impact on the sharp spike in the poverty rate in West Java Province relative to other areas such as Riau, Jambi, West Kalimantan, and North Sulawesi. West Java also had the second national unemployment rate percentage before the pandemic under Banten Province and became the province with the third-highest national unemployment percentage after the pandemic under Riau Islands Province and Banten Province. The results of visualization through a scatter plot also show similar results, with a significant positive relationship between the unemployment rate and poverty rate with a correlation coefficient of 0.89 (Pearson's Correlation Coefficient) and 0.85 (Spearman's Correlation Coefficient). Thus, it can be concluded that there is a strong correlation between the unemployment rate and the poverty rate in West Java.

## Solutions and Recommendations

We implemented clustering method to group regions in West Java based on the severity of poverty, unemployment and MSMEs due to the pandemic and we found that there were 4 main regional clusters in West Java. From the results of further analysis on the characteristics of each cluster, the following government policy recommendations can be formulated:

- Accelerating business digitalization process, especially in the culinary sector: 

Culinary business is a business that has good market potential for the middle class and marginalized people. This is reflected in the contribution of the culinary sector to the GDP of the creative economy, which is rated at the highest, reaching 41% in 2020. The utilization of this market potential is carried out by implementing the digitalization of culinary businesses so that they can continue to reach demand without being limited by the limited mobility of the community.

- Empowering SMEs on culinary sector for the community in the cluster 2 regions: 

Empowerment in the form of mentoring and counseling of culinary businesses to the community is carried out to cluster 2 areas which include Sukabumi City, Cirebon City, Cimahi City, Bogor City, Purwakarta Regency, Kuningan Regency, and Sumedang Regency which are considered to have the highest high poverty rate and the lowest number of SMEs.
